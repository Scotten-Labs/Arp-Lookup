# Arp-Lookup
ARP Lookup with Manufacturer Data

Simple Python script to perform an ARP log of all the devices on the network. Also does an API request to get the manufacturer of each device, if one can be found. Only works on MacOS due to the nature of the script and will need another script or software to update the ARP table manually.
